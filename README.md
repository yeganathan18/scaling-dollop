This is Yeganathan, sophomore at Amrita School of Engineering (CSE 2020).

## About the Tasks

I tried completing the whole tasks in 2-3days of time and since the time limit is short, focused on the functionalities > design/performance. I was able to identify myself some parts which can be implemented efficiently and will work on those in coming days. Overall the tasks were pretty good.

## Short Intro

A passionate Full-stack developer, soaking up as much knowledge and practice as I can in an attempt to perfect my craft. My areas of interest include product design, software development, problem-solving, and business development.

I love building APIs, applying responsive design principles and watching my web pages shrink into mobile screens and still look amazing. It's oddly satisfying.

Being a keen learner I can grab onto any other programming languages, frameworks, or principles and start working on a project from day one.
