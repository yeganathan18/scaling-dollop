This is Yeganathan, sophomore at Amrita School of Engineering (CSE 2020).

## About the Tasks

I tried completing the whole task in a span of 2-3 days and since the time limit was short, focus on the functionalities > design/performance. I have identified some parts of the task which could've been implemented more efficiently, and will be working on those in the coming days. Overall the tasks were pretty good.

## Short Intro

A passionate Full-stack developer, soaking up as much knowledge and practice as I can in an attempt to perfect my craft. My areas of interest include product design, software development, problem-solving, and business development.

I love building APIs, applying responsive design principles and watching my web pages shrink into mobile screens and still look amazing. It's oddly satisfying.

Being a keen learner I can grab onto any other programming languages, frameworks, or principles and start working on a project from day one.
